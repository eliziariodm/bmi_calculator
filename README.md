<h1>BMI calculator app project made with the Flutter framework.</h1>

<p style="text-align:justify">The body mass index (BMI) is an international measure used to calculate whether a person is at ideal weight. Developed by the polymath Lambert Qu√©telet at the end of the 19th century, it is an easy and quick method for assessing the level of fat in each person, and is therefore an international predictor of obesity adopted by the World Health Organization (WHO).<p>
